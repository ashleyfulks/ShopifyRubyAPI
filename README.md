# ShopifyRubyAPI
Ruby code to interact with Shopify API public


This repository is a demo of how to connect Ruby to Shopify's API using basic authentication.
This is especially helpful in automating difficult tasks, such as mass deleting customers.
We are using HTTParty to connect to the shop's API and then we can use some logic to create loops and have fancy stuff like arrays of data.
I know this seems really simple, it is, but I had a hard time finding a simple way to make changes through the API without installing
an app on the store and this is just enough to do it. This is also setup for beginners like myself!


Files you need are:

basicApp.rb - a simple Ruby app to call API commands

.env - a place to store your store and private app variables seperate from the main file


Feel free to fork and make changes to the code to whatever your needs are!
